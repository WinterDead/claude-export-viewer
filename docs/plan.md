# Claude Export Viewer — Plan

> **Provenance note.** The original v1.0 working plan (the section numbering that code comments
> such as "plan §12 step 7" refer to) lived in chat sessions and was never committed. This file
> replaces it as the canonical plan document from v1.1 onward. The §-references in code comments
> are historical; treat the commit history and CLAUDE.md as the record of v1.0 decisions.

## v1.0 — shipped (locked decisions)

Tagged `v1.0.0` (commit `a0de01a`). Feature-complete viewer: parser with preserve-and-flag
handling, branching conversation detail, project list/detail with knowledge docs and prompt
template, manual project tagging (per-row + bulk, CSRF-protected), FTS5 search with
natural-language preprocessing and branch-aware result links, memory view with collapsible
sections, export upload with parse-before-replace and atomic file moves, pickle parse cache
keyed on `(zip_sha256, parser_module_sha256)`, three-bucket TagState with orphan banner and
explicit-confirm purge. 229 tests passing at tag time.

Decisions locked in v1.0 (do not relitigate without a written brief):

- Flask + Jinja2 server-side rendering, no SPA; SQLite + FTS5 via stdlib `sqlite3`.
- Preserve-and-flag over raise for unexpected export data (see CLAUDE.md for the full list).
- Parse-before-replace upload flow; atomic tempfile-rename writes for the zip and pickle cache.
- Tags persist across uploads; orphan rows are surfaced, never auto-pruned.
- Search-snippet highlighting rides the substitute-then-markdown path; `<mark>` stays on the
  bleach allowlist (load-bearing).

## v1.1 — roadmap

- **Session A** *(shipped)* — sender label change ("human" → "User"), search syntax guide,
  upload history log. Locked decisions:
  - Sender labels are display-layer only, via the `sender_label` Jinja filter
    (`viewer/render.py`): "human" → "User", "assistant" → "Assistant", unknown senders pass
    through raw. Parser values, FTS index content, and the pickle-cache key are untouched.
  - The search syntax guide is a native `<details>` block in `templates/search.html`, present in
    all three page states (empty, results, syntax error). Its copy was verified claim-by-claim
    against the live preprocessor + FTS5 — treat the copy as documentation of actual behaviour.
  - Upload history lives in `upload_history` (`cache/viewer.sqlite`, `viewer/history.py`).
    Recorded after successful parse only: uploads always; startup loads of a real export only
    when the sha differs from the latest row; fixture loads never. The `zip_sha256` is the same
    digest that keys the pickle cache, hashed once per flow.
- **Session B** — "No Project" sentinel tag (design settled in chat; spec to follow).
- **Session C** — `/help` page in the nav, content adapted from the user guide.
- **Session D** — artifact-encoding discovery against the real export (no app code).
- **Session E** — setup script (Python-presence check tier).
- **Session F** — client-side syntax highlighting via vendored highlight.js.
- **Session G** — README rewrite, LICENSE, synthetic-fixture screenshots, tag v1.1.0.

## v1.2 — gate items (out of scope for v1.1)

- **Public-readiness audit** before the repo goes public: secret-key handling, host-binding
  confirmation, dependency pins.
